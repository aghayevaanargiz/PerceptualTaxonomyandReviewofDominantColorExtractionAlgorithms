## Abstract
Human vision prioritizes small but visually prominent colors, a tiny red patch in a green scene can dominate attention, yet many algorithms overlook such areas. This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of perception-aware dominant color extraction (DCE) methods. It examines techniques like clustering in perceptually uniform color spaces, fuzzy logic for handling uncertainty, and deep learning incorporating semantics and saliency. We provide a comparative analysis of the principles, strengths, and limitations of these approaches, highlighting key trade-offs between efficiency, interpretability, and perceptual fidelity. This work guides the development of robust, human-aligned DCE systems for computer vision and design applications.
